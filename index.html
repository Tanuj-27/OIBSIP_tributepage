            Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in domestic
            cricket. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in
            the history of the sport.He is the highest run scorer in T20I and
            IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male

            run-scorer in international cricket and stands second in the list of
            most international centuries scored. He also holds the record for
            scoring the most centuries in One Day International cricket.[4][5]

            World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. In 2013, Kohli was ranked
            number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2018, he was
            ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to
            hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the
            first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade.
